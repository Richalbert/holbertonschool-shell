Alea iacta est

Alea iacta est ("The die is cast") is a Latin phrase attributed by Suetonius
(as iacta alea est) to Julius Caesar on January 10, 49 BC
as he led his army across the Rubicon river in Northern Italy. With this step,
he entered Italy at the head of his army in defiance of the Senate and began
his long civil war against Pompey and the Optimates. The phrase has been
adopted in Italian (Il dado è tratto), Romanian (Zarurile au fost aruncate),
Spanish (La suerte está echada), French (Les dés sont jetés), Portuguese (A
sorte está lançada), Dutch (De teerling is geworpen),
German (Der Würfel ist gefallen), Hungarian (A kocka el van vetve) and many other languages to
indicate that events have passed a point of no return.


Alea iacta est ("The die is cast") is a variation of a Latin phrase (iacta alea est [ˈjakta ˈaːlɛ.a ˈɛs̺t]) attributed by Suetonius to Julius Caesar on 10 January 49 BC, as he led his army across the Rubicon river in Northern Italy, in defiance of the Roman Senate and beginning a long civil war against Pompey and the Optimates. The phrase is often used to indicate events that have passed a point of no return.

The phrase was a quote from a play by Menander, and according to Plutarch, Caesar originally said the line in Greek rather than Latin. The Latin version is now most commonly cited with the word order changed (Alea iacta est), and it is used both in this form, and in translation in many languages. The same event inspired another related idiom, "crossing the Rubicon".
